## Generating Images with AI

Need an image for your app? Just ask the agent to create one. Describe what you want, and AI generates it for you.

**Example requests:**

- "Create a hero image of a modern office with plants"
- "Generate an icon of a shopping cart, flat design, blue"
- "Make a background pattern with geometric shapes"

## How to Generate an Image

1. Open your project and go to Agent Mode
2. Describe the image you want
3. Optionally specify the size (see below)
4. Wait a few seconds for generation
5. The image appears in your project's `public/` folder

**Example conversation:**

> **You:** Create a banner image for a coffee shop website, warm colors, cozy atmosphere
>
> **Agent:** I'll generate that image for you. What size would you like? The default is 16:9 (widescreen).
>
> **You:** Square is fine
>
> **Agent:** Done! I've created the image and saved it to `/public/coffee-banner.png`. Want me to add it to your homepage?

## Choosing Size and Style

### Available Sizes

| Aspect Ratio | Best For |
|--------------|----------|
| 1:1 (Square) | Profile pictures, icons, thumbnails |
| 16:9 | Hero banners, video thumbnails |
| 4:3 | Standard photos, cards |
| 3:2 | Landscape photos |
| 9:16 | Mobile screens, stories |
| 2:3 | Portrait photos |
| 21:9 | Ultra-wide banners |
| 3:1 | Website headers |
| 1:3 | Vertical banners |
| 4:5 | Social media posts |

### Style Tips

Be specific about style in your prompt:

- **"Flat design"** — Simple, minimal, modern
- **"Realistic photo"** — Photographic quality
- **"Illustration"** — Hand-drawn or artistic style
- **"Minimalist"** — Clean with lots of white space
- **"3D render"** — Three-dimensional objects

## Where Images Are Saved

Generated images automatically save to your project's `public/` folder. The filename is based on your prompt, with automatic numbering if a similar file exists.

**Example:** `coffee-banner.png`, `coffee-banner-2.png`

You can find your images in:
- Code Editor → `public/` folder
- Or ask the agent: "Show me the images in my project"

## Using Generated Images

After generation, ask the agent to add the image to your app:

- "Add this image as the hero banner on the homepage"
- "Use this as the background for the contact section"
- "Replace the current logo with this image"

## For Developers

### Generation Engine

Images are generated using Gemini 2.5 Flash via MCP tool integration.

### Processing Pipeline

1. Request received via Claude Agent MCP tool
2. Job queued in BullMQ
3. Worker processes with Gemini 2.5 Flash
4. Image uploaded to R2 storage
5. PAR (Pre-Authenticated Request) URL generated (15min TTL)
6. File copied to project's `/public` folder

### File Naming

- Collision detection with auto-increment
- Filename derived from prompt (slugified)
- Format: `{slug}-{increment}.png`

### API Reference

Image generation is triggered through the Claude Agent's MCP toolset. Direct API access:

```
POST /api/image-generation/generate
{
  "prompt": "description of image",
  "aspectRatio": "16:9",
  "projectId": "uuid"
}
```

### Storage

- Temporary: R2 bucket with PAR URLs
- Permanent: Project's PVC at `/public/{filename}`

### Rate Limits

- 3 retries on failure
- Queued processing via BullMQ
- Concurrent limit based on plan tier
