## What is Agent Mode?

Agent Mode is your AI-powered assistant inside OptiDev. Instead of writing code yourself, you describe what you want in plain English, and the agent builds it for you.

Think of it as having a developer on your team who's always available. You can ask it to:

- Build new features ("Add a contact form with email validation")
- Fix problems ("The button isn't working, can you fix it?")
- Explain how things work ("How does the login flow work?")
- Make changes ("Change the header color to blue")

## Working with the Agent

The agent has two modes that work together automatically:

### Plan Mode
When you ask for something, the agent first creates a plan. It shows you what it intends to do before making changes. Review the plan and approve it to continue.

### Execute Mode
Once you approve the plan, the agent writes code and makes changes to your project. You'll see files being created or modified in real-time.

| Mode | Access Level | Use Case |
|------|--------------|----------|
| `plan` | Read-only | Architecture planning, reviewing proposed changes |
| `execute` | Full write access | Feature implementation, bug fixes, modifications |

## How to Use Agent Mode

1. Open your project in OptiDev
2. Look for the **Agent** panel on the right side
3. Type your request in plain English
4. Watch the agent work and respond to any questions it asks
5. Review the changes in your project

## Tips for Better Results

**Be specific about what you want**
- Good: "Add a signup form with name, email, and password fields"
- Vague: "Add a form"

**Describe the outcome you need**
- Good: "When users click Submit, save their data and show a success message"
- Vague: "Make the form work"

**Ask follow-up questions**
The agent remembers your conversation. If something isn't right, just say "Make the button bigger" or "Change the color to red" without repeating the whole context.

**Let the agent handle errors**
If you see an error message, copy and paste it to the agent. It can usually diagnose and fix the problem.

## Auto-Save and History

Your conversation with the agent is saved automatically. If you close the browser and come back, you can pick up where you left off.

The agent also auto-commits your changes to version history, so you can always roll back if needed.
