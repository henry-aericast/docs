## How Publishing Works

When you publish your app, OptiDev:

1. Builds your project (compiles all the code)
2. Uploads it to our global network
3. Gives you a live URL anyone can visit

Your app gets a free URL like `yourproject.dev.optidev.com`. You can also [use your own domain](/features/custom-domain).

## Publishing Your App

### From the Dashboard

1. Open your project in OptiDev
2. Click the **Publish** button in the top-right corner
3. Wait for the build to complete (usually 1-2 minutes)
4. Your live URL appears when ready

### Using Agent Mode

Just ask the agent:

> "Publish my app"

The agent handles the build and deploy process for you.

## What Happens During Publishing

### Build Phase

OptiDev compiles your code into optimized files:

- Bundles JavaScript for faster loading
- Optimizes images
- Minifies code (makes files smaller)

You'll see a progress indicator. If there are errors, they'll appear with instructions to fix them.

### Deploy Phase

After a successful build:

- Files upload to CloudFlare's global network
- Your app becomes available worldwide
- SSL certificate ensures secure connections (https)

## Checking Deploy Status

### View Recent Deploys

1. Open your project
2. Click **Settings** → **Deploys**
3. See a list of all deployments with status and date

### Deploy Statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Building** | Code is being compiled |
| **Deploying** | Files are being uploaded |
| **Live** | Your app is published and accessible |
| **Failed** | Something went wrong (see error message) |

## Fixing Build Errors

If publishing fails, you'll see an error message. Common issues:

**"Build failed"**
- Ask the agent: "The build failed, can you fix it?"
- The agent reviews the error and makes corrections

**"Missing dependencies"**
- Usually means a package wasn't installed correctly
- Ask the agent: "Install missing dependencies and try again"

## Rollback to Previous Version

Made a mistake? You can go back to an earlier version:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Deploys**
2. Find the version you want to restore
3. Click **Rollback**
4. Confirm the rollback

Your app immediately reverts to that version.

## Preview Before Publishing

Want to test before going live? Your project has a live preview while you're editing. The preview URL is only accessible to you.

Once you're happy with the preview, publish to make it public.
