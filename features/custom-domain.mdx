## Why Use a Custom Domain?

By default, your app is available at `yourproject.dev.optidev.com`. A custom domain lets you use your own address, like:

- `app.yourcompany.com`
- `dashboard.mybusiness.com`
- `tools.myteam.io`

Custom domains look more professional and are easier for your users to remember.

## Connecting Your Domain

### What You'll Need

- A domain you own (purchased from GoDaddy, Namecheap, Google Domains, etc.)
- Access to your domain's DNS settings

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Open Domain Settings**
   - Go to your project in OptiDev
   - Click **Settings** → **Domain**
   - Click **Add Custom Domain**

2. **Enter Your Domain**
   - Type your domain (e.g., `app.yourcompany.com`)
   - Click **Continue**

3. **Add DNS Record**
   - OptiDev shows you a DNS record to add
   - Go to your domain provider's website
   - Find DNS settings (sometimes called "DNS Management" or "Name Servers")
   - Add the record OptiDev gives you

4. **Verify**
   - Return to OptiDev
   - Click **Verify Domain**
   - Wait a few minutes for DNS to update (can take up to 24 hours, but usually faster)

5. **Done!**
   - Once verified, your domain is connected
   - Your app is now accessible at your custom domain

### DNS Record Types

OptiDev will ask you to add one of these:

| Record Type | When Used | Example |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| **CNAME** | For subdomains like `app.yourcompany.com` | Points to `yourproject.dev.optidev.com` |
| **TXT** | For verification | Proves you own the domain |

<Tip>
If you're unsure how to add DNS records, search "[your domain provider] add CNAME record" for specific instructions.

## SSL and Security

### Automatic HTTPS

Every custom domain gets a free SSL certificate automatically. This means:

- Your site uses `https://` (secure connection)
- Visitors see the padlock icon in their browser
- Data is encrypted between your users and your app

You don't need to do anything—SSL is set up when you connect your domain.

### Certificate Renewal

SSL certificates renew automatically. No action needed on your part.

## Troubleshooting

### "Domain not verified"

DNS changes can take time to spread across the internet. Wait 15-30 minutes and try verifying again. In rare cases, it can take up to 24 hours.

### "SSL certificate pending"

After verification, SSL setup takes a few minutes. Your site may show a security warning briefly. Wait 5-10 minutes and refresh.

### "Domain already in use"

Each domain can only be connected to one project. If you've used this domain before, remove it from the old project first.

## Removing a Custom Domain

1. Go to **Settings** → **Domain**
2. Find the domain you want to remove
3. Click **Remove**
4. Your app returns to using the default `*.dev.optidev.com` URL
