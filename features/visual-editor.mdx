## What is Visual Editor?

Visual Editor lets you edit your app's appearance by clicking on elements directly—no coding required. Want to change a headline? Click it and type. Need a different color? Select the element and pick from the color palette.

It's like editing a document, but for your app.

## Selecting and Editing Elements

### How to Select

1. Open your project in OptiDev
2. Click the **Visual Editor** tab above your app preview
3. Click any element on your page (text, buttons, images, etc.)
4. A blue outline appears showing what's selected

### What You Can Edit

Once you select an element, the sidebar shows options you can change:

- **Text content** — Click and type to change words
- **Colors** — Background, text color, borders
- **Size** — Width, height, padding, margins
- **Position** — Move elements around the page
- **Visibility** — Show or hide elements

## Common Tasks

### Change Text

1. Click on any text element
2. The text becomes editable
3. Type your new content
4. Click outside to save

### Change Colors

1. Select an element
2. In the sidebar, find **Background** or **Text Color**
3. Click the color swatch
4. Pick a new color or enter a hex code

### Adjust Spacing

1. Select an element
2. Look for **Padding** (space inside) or **Margin** (space outside)
3. Drag the sliders or enter specific values

### Rearrange Elements

1. Select an element
2. Drag it to a new position
3. Drop it where you want

## Working with Agent Mode

Visual Editor and Agent Mode work together. If you can't find an option in Visual Editor, just ask the agent:

- "Move this section above the header"
- "Make all buttons rounded"
- "Add a shadow to this card"

The agent makes the code changes, and you see the results in Visual Editor.

## Limitations

Some changes are easier to make through Agent Mode:

- Adding new sections or components
- Complex layouts with multiple columns
- Interactive features (forms, popups, animations)
- Changes that affect multiple pages at once

When in doubt, describe what you want to the agent—it'll figure out the best approach.

## For Developers

### Architecture

Visual Editor uses a 3-layer architecture:

1. **Utils Layer** — DOM queries, element identification
2. **Coordinators** — Selection state, layers, undo/redo history
3. **Communication** — postMessage bridge between editor and iframe

### How Edits Work

Visual edits trigger TypeScript AST transformations via the Claude Agent:

1. User makes visual change
2. Change sent via postMessage to parent
3. Batch API collects changes
4. Agent performs AST transformation on JSX/TSX files
5. Hot Module Reload (HMR) updates preview

### Iframe Isolation

The preview runs in an isolated iframe with:
- Separate DOM context
- postMessage communication only
- No direct parent access

### Batch API

Multiple visual changes are batched to reduce agent calls:

```
POST /api/visual-editor/batch
{
  "changes": [
    { "selector": ".header", "property": "backgroundColor", "value": "#fff" },
    { "selector": ".title", "property": "textContent", "value": "New Title" }
  ]
}
```

### Auto-Commit

Visual changes trigger auto-commit with AI-generated commit messages when the editing session completes.
