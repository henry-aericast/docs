## Why Connect to GitHub?

GitHub integration lets you:

- **Back up your code** - Your project is safely stored on GitHub
- **Collaborate with your team** - Others can view and contribute to your code
- **Track changes** - See the history of every update
- **Import existing projects** - Bring your GitHub repos into OptiDev

## Connecting Your GitHub Account

Before linking projects, you need to connect your GitHub account to OptiDev.

### Step-by-Step

1. Go to **Settings** (bottom of the sidebar)
2. Select the **GitHub** tab
3. Click **Connect GitHub Account**
4. GitHub opens in a new window
5. Review the permissions and click **Authorize**
6. You're redirected back to OptiDev

Your GitHub account now appears in the Connections list.

<Tip>
You can connect multiple GitHub accounts if you use different accounts for personal and work projects.

## Push Your Project to GitHub (starting with OptiDev)

Have an OptiDev project you want to back up or share? Push it to GitHub.

### Create a New Repository

1. Open your project in OptiDev
2. Click the **GitHub** button in the toolbar
3. Select your GitHub account
4. Choose **Create new repository**
5. Enter a repository name
6. Select the owner (your account or an organization)
7. Choose public or private
8. Click **Transfer**

Your project code is now on GitHub.

### Connect to an Existing Repository

1. Open your project in OptiDev
2. Click the **GitHub** button
3. Select your GitHub account
4. Choose **Use existing repository**
5. Select the repository from the list
6. Click **Connect**

## Import from GitHub (starting with a repo)

Already have a project on GitHub? Import it directly into OptiDev.

1. From the dashboard, click **New Project**
2. Select **Import from GitHub**
3. Choose your GitHub account
4. Browse or search for the repository
5. Select the branch to import
6. Click **Import**

OptiDev clones the repository and sets up your development environment automatically.

### Deployment Compatibility

OptiDev can deploy **Vite-based projects** (React, Vue, etc.). Other project types like Next.js, Python, or Node.js backends can be developed in OptiDev but need external hosting for deployment.

| Project Type | Development | Deployment |
|--------------|-------------|------------|
| Vite (React, Vue) | Yes | Yes |
| Next.js | Yes | External hosting |
| Python | Yes | External hosting |
| Node.js backend | Yes | External hosting |

## Syncing Changes

Once your project is connected to GitHub (either by pushing or importing), syncing is automatic.

### Automatic Push

OptiDev automatically pushes your changes to GitHub every time you save (commit). You don't need to do anything—every change appears on GitHub within seconds.

### Pulling Updates

If there are new changes to your GitHub repository, you can pull them into OptiDev.

1. Open your project
2. Click the **GitHub** button
3. Click **Pull**
4. Changes from GitHub are merged into your project

<Warning>
If you have unsaved changes in OptiDev, commit them first to avoid conflicts.
</Warning>

### Viewing Your Commits

- On **GitHub**: Go to your repository and click "Commits"
- In **OptiDev**: Open your project and click on the <Icon icon="clock" /> icon (Version History)

## Organization Access

For organization repositories, you may need to grant OptiDev access:

1. Go to **Settings** → **GitHub**
2. Click **Install App on Org** next to your connection
3. Select your organization on GitHub
4. Choose which repositories OptiDev can access
5. Click **Install**

This gives OptiDev access to organization repos, even if team members change.

## Disconnecting

### Unlink a Project

1. Open your project
2. Click the **GitHub** button
3. Click **Disconnect**

Your project stays in OptiDev, but changes no longer sync to GitHub.

### Remove GitHub Account

1. Go to **Settings** → **GitHub**
2. Find the account to remove
3. Click the trash icon
4. Confirm removal

All projects linked to that account are unlinked automatically.

## Troubleshooting

### "Permission denied" when pushing

Your GitHub token may have expired. Go to Settings → GitHub, remove the connection, and reconnect.

### Changes not appearing on GitHub

Check that GitHub sync is enabled:
1. Open your project
2. Click the **GitHub** button
3. Ensure the toggle is on

### Can't see organization repositories

You need to install the OptiDev app on your organization. Click **Install App on Org** in Settings → GitHub.

### Import shows errors but project works

Some warnings during import are normal (like missing optional configs). If your project runs correctly, you can ignore them.
