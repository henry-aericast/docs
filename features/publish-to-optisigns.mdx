## What is OptiSigns Integration?

OptiSigns is a digital signage platform that powers screens in offices, stores, restaurants, and public spaces. With OptiDev's integration, you can build an app and display it directly on any OptiSigns-connected screen.

**Perfect for:**

- Office dashboards showing KPIs and metrics
- Retail displays with promotions and product info
- Restaurant menus that update in real-time
- Lobby directories and wayfinding
- Kiosk applications for self-service

## How to Publish

### Prerequisites

- An OptiSigns account with screens set up
- A published OptiDev app (the system will prompt you to publish if needed)

### Step-by-Step

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Publish Menu">
    In your project editor, click the **Published** button in the top toolbar, then select **Publish to OptiSigns** from the dropdown.

    <img
      src="/images/publish-to-optisigns/publish-dropdown.png"
      alt="Publish dropdown showing Publish to OptiSigns option"
      style={{maxWidth: "260px"}}
    />

    <Note>
    If your app isn't published yet, you'll be prompted to publish first. Choose your visibility setting and click **Publish**. The OptiSigns flow continues automatically once deployment completes.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate API Key (first time only)">
    On first use, you'll need to generate a workspace API key. Click **Generate Key** to create your secure key.

    <img
      src="/images/publish-to-optisigns/api-key-required.png"
      alt="API Key Required modal with Generate Key button"
      style={{maxWidth: "320px"}}
    />

    Once generated, the key is displayed. You can copy it if needed for other integrations. Click **Continue to OptiSigns** to proceed.

    <img
      src="/images/publish-to-optisigns/api-key-generated.png"
      alt="API key generated successfully modal"
      style={{maxWidth: "320px"}}
    />

    <Tip>
    You only need to generate this key once per workspace. Future publishes will skip this step.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Folder">
    The OptiSigns picker opens with three steps: **Select**, **Build**, and **Assign**.

    - Choose your team from the dropdown
    - Select a folder to save your app as an asset
    - Click **Continue** to proceed

  <Step title="Configure Your App">
    In the **Build** step, configure how your app appears in OptiSigns:

    - **Name** - Give your app a recognizable name
    - **Preview** - See how your app looks in landscape or portrait mode
    - Click **Assign to Screens** to continue, or **Save** to assign later

    In the **Assign** step, select which screens display your app:

    - **Target** - Choose to assign to screens or screen groups
    - **Screens** - Select the specific screens
    - Click **Assign** to push your app to screens, or **Assign Later** to do this from the OptiSigns dashboard

  <Step title="Done!">
    Your app is now saved as an asset in OptiSigns and assigned to your selected screens. The app will appear on the screens within seconds.
