## What is OptiSigns Integration?

OptiSigns is a digital signage platform that powers screens in offices, stores, restaurants, and public spaces. With OptiDev's integration, you can build an app and display it directly on any OptiSigns-connected screen.

**Perfect for:**

- Office dashboards showing KPIs and metrics
- Retail displays with promotions and product info
- Restaurant menus that update in real-time
- Lobby directories and wayfinding
- Kiosk applications for self-service

## Sending Your App to Screens

### Prerequisites

- An OptiSigns account with screens set up
- A published OptiDev app (see [Publish Your App](/features/publish-your-app))

### Step-by-Step

1. **Publish Your App First**
   - Make sure your app is published and working at its URL
   - Test it in a browser to confirm everything looks right

2. **Open OptiSigns Integration**
   - In your project, click **Settings** → **OptiSigns**
   - Click **Connect to OptiSigns**

3. **Sign In to OptiSigns**
   - Log in with your OptiSigns account
   - Authorize OptiDev to access your screens

4. **Select Screens**
   - Choose which screens should display your app
   - You can select individual screens or screen groups

5. **Push to Screens**
   - Click **Publish to Screens**
   - Your app appears on the selected screens within seconds

## Managing Screen Content

### Updating Your App

When you make changes and republish your app:

1. The screens automatically get the update
2. No need to push again—it happens automatically
3. Changes appear within a few minutes

### Removing from Screens

1. Go to **Settings** → **OptiSigns**
2. Find the screen(s) you want to update
3. Click **Remove** to stop displaying your app

### Scheduling (via OptiSigns)

For scheduling when your app appears:

1. Go to your OptiSigns dashboard
2. Create a playlist that includes your OptiDev app
3. Set the schedule in OptiSigns

## Design Tips for Screens

### Consider the Viewing Distance

- Use large fonts (minimum 24px for body text)
- High contrast colors
- Simple, uncluttered layouts

### Optimize for the Screen Size

- Digital signage is typically 1920x1080 (landscape) or 1080x1920 (portrait)
- Design with this resolution in mind
- Test how your app looks at different sizes

### Auto-Refresh Data

If your app shows live data (like dashboards):

- Set up automatic data refresh
- Ask the agent: "Make this dashboard refresh every 5 minutes"

### Avoid User Input

Most digital signage screens don't have keyboards or touch:

- Design for view-only content
- For kiosks with touch, design large tap targets

## For Developers

### Integration Architecture

```
OptiDev App → Published URL → OptiSigns Playlist → Screen Display
```

OptiSigns loads your app URL in a managed browser on the display device.

### OptiSigns Picker SDK

Integration uses the OptiSigns Picker SDK:

1. OAuth authorization flow
2. Screen/group selection UI
3. Asset creation in OptiSigns account
4. Automatic URL updates on republish

### Screen Specifications

| Orientation | Resolution | Aspect Ratio |
|-------------|------------|--------------|
| Landscape | 1920x1080 | 16:9 |
| Portrait | 1080x1920 | 9:16 |
| Ultra-wide | 3840x1080 | 32:9 |

### Update Propagation

- App republish triggers webhook to OptiSigns
- OptiSigns refreshes the URL on all linked screens
- Typical propagation time: 1-5 minutes

### API Reference

```
POST /api/integrations/optisigns/connect
{
  "projectId": "uuid",
  "authCode": "oauth-code"
}

POST /api/integrations/optisigns/publish
{
  "projectId": "uuid",
  "screenIds": ["screen-1", "screen-2"]
}

DELETE /api/integrations/optisigns/screens/:screenId
```

### Kiosk Mode Considerations

For touch-enabled kiosks:

- Ensure buttons are minimum 44x44px
- Implement timeout/reset after inactivity
- Consider network fallback for offline scenarios
