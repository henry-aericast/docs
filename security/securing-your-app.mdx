## Public vs Private Apps

Every app you build has a visibility setting that controls who can access it.

| Visibility | Who Can Access | Best For |
|------------|----------------|----------|
| **Public** | Anyone with the link | Marketing sites, portfolios, public tools |
| **Private** | Only workspace members + OptiSigns displays | Internal dashboards, sensitive data, company tools |

### Changing Visibility

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Project Settings">
    In the Power Editor, click the **gear icon** next to your project name, or go to **Settings** tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find Content Visibility">
    Scroll to **Project Information** and look for **Content Visibility**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Your Setting">
    Choose **Public** or **Private**. Your choice takes effect after your next publish.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Changing from public to private doesn't revoke access immediately. Publish again to apply the new setting.
</Warning>

## Securely Display on OptiSigns Screens

If you're using OptiSigns digital signage, your private apps can display on screens without exposing them to the public internet.

### How It Works

1. **Private apps stay private** — they're only accessible through authenticated OptiSigns hardware
2. **No public URLs** — viewers can't bookmark or share a direct link to your content
3. **Workspace-level control** — manage which screens can display your apps

### Setting Up OptiSigns Display

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate Your API Key">
    Go to **Workspace Settings → API Keys** and click **Generate Key**.

    You'll see a Key ID and Secret. **Save the secret now** — you won't see it again.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect in OptiSigns">
    In your OptiSigns account, add the API key to link your workspace.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Your App to a Screen">
    Browse your OptiDev apps from within OptiSigns and add them to your playlist.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Your API key works for all apps in your workspace. You only need to set this up once.
</Tip>

## Adding Auth to Your App

Want users to log in before accessing your app? OptiDev Cloud includes built-in authentication — no coding required.

### What You Get

- **Email/password login** — users create accounts with their email
- **Social login** — let users sign in with Google (more providers coming soon)
- **User management** — see who signed up, disable accounts, reset passwords

### Enabling Authentication

<Steps>
  <Step title="Activate OptiDev Cloud">
    In your project, go to **Settings → OptiDev Cloud** and click **Activate**.

    This takes about 2-3 minutes the first time (instant after that).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Auth Providers">
    Once active, click the **Auth** tab. Toggle on the login methods you want:
    - **Email** — users sign up with email and password
    - **Phone** — users sign up with phone number (SMS verification)
    - **Google** — one-click Google sign-in
  </Step>
  <Step title="Control Signups">
    Toggle **Disable Signup** if you want to manually add users instead of allowing self-registration.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  After enabling auth, your app needs login UI. Ask the Agent: *"Add a login page using OptiDev Cloud Auth"* — it handles the rest.
</Info>

### Managing Users

Once auth is enabled, the **Users** tab shows everyone who signed up. From here you can:

- See when users last signed in
- Disable or delete accounts
- View user metadata

## Run Security Review on Your App

Before publishing, it's good practice to review your app for common security issues.

### Pre-Publish Checklist

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Check your visibility setting">
    Is your app **Public** when it should be **Private**? Double-check in Project Settings before publishing.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Review environment variables">
    Go to **Settings → Secrets** and verify:
    - API keys are marked as **Sensitive** (hidden from logs)
    - No test credentials left in production
    - Database passwords aren't visible to collaborators who shouldn't see them
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Test your auth flow">
    If your app has login:
    - Try accessing protected pages without signing in
    - Verify logout actually logs users out
    - Test password reset if enabled
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Check external connections">
    Review **Settings → Connections** for any services your app uses. Make sure:
    - Test/sandbox connections aren't used in production
    - Unused connections are removed
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Ask the Agent for Help

Not sure if something is secure? Ask Claude directly:

> *"Review my app for security issues before I publish"*

The Agent will scan your code for common problems like exposed credentials, missing auth checks, or insecure API calls.

## For Developers

<Accordion title="Technical reference">

### Visibility Implementation
- Visibility stored in `projects.visibility` column (`PUBLIC` | `PRIVATE`)
- Private projects require workspace membership or valid OptiSigns hardware token
- Setting change requires republish — cached CDN content isn't invalidated automatically

### OptiSigns Integration
- API keys are workspace-scoped, stored with AES-256-GCM encryption
- Key pair: `keyId` (public identifier) + `secret` (one-time display)
- Hardware authentication uses HMAC signature validation

### OptiDev Cloud Auth
- Built on Supabase Auth with session pooler (port 5432)
- Environment variables injected: `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- Supports JWT verification, row-level security policies
- Auth state managed client-side via `@supabase/supabase-js`

### Secrets Security
- All secrets encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM
- Three visibility levels: Visible, Masked (first/last 4 chars), Sensitive (hidden)
- 64KB total budget per project for environment variables

</Accordion>
