---

OptiDev is built for enterprise teams. This page explains the security controls in place across infrastructure, authentication, data handling, and AI.

## Infrastructure & Data Residency

All customer data is stored and processed in the United States.

| Provider | Role | Region |
|---|---|---|
| Oracle Cloud Infrastructure | Compute, Kubernetes, object storage, PostgreSQL, Redis | US |
| Cloudflare | CDN, DDoS protection, TLS, R2 storage | Global edge, US origin |
| Supabase | Backend-as-a-service for user projects | User-chosen |

### Network Architecture

Customer requests pass through Cloudflare for TLS termination and DDoS protection before reaching the OptiDev API. Development containers run inside Kubernetes and are never directly reachable from the internet — access is issued only after the API has verified your identity and confirmed ownership.

### Network Isolation

Each development container is isolated at the network layer:

- **No inter-container communication** — containers cannot reach each other
- **Egress restricted** — outbound traffic is limited to necessary external services
- **No lateral movement** between workspaces at the network layer

---

## Authentication & Access Control

### Identity

OptiDev uses **Firebase Authentication** (Google) as the identity layer. Tokens are verified server-side on every API request — client-supplied tokens are never trusted without server-side verification. Unauthenticated requests are rejected.

### Enterprise SSO (SAML 2.0)

<Note>
SSO is available on Enterprise plans. See the [Single Sign-On guide](/security/single-sign-on) for setup instructions.
</Note>

Connect your existing identity provider via SAML 2.0. Supported out of the box:

- Okta
- Azure Active Directory / Microsoft Entra ID
- Any SAML 2.0-compliant IdP

SAML features include:

- **Just-in-time provisioning** — accounts created automatically on first login, no manual provisioning needed
- **Group-based role assignment** — map IdP groups to workspace roles (Admin, User, Viewer)
- **Configurable attribute mapping** — handles non-standard attribute names across IdPs
- **Domain verification required** — only verified domain administrators can configure SSO
- **Sync on login** — optionally keep display name and workspace membership in sync with your IdP

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

MFA is available through OptiPrime, our identity platform:

- **TOTP** — Google Authenticator, Authy, 1Password, or any TOTP app
- **SMS** — phone number verification
- **Backup codes** — securely hashed before storage; single-use with usage tracking

<Tip>
Sensitive operations like disabling MFA or regenerating backup codes require re-authentication before proceeding.
</Tip>

### OAuth 2.0 + PKCE

All OAuth flows use **PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)** with SHA-256. Plain PKCE is rejected. Authorization codes are short-lived and single-use.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Workspace roles — **Owner**, **Admin**, **User**, and **Viewer** — determine what each member can do. Permissions are enforced server-side on every request, not just at the UI layer.

### Multi-Tenant Data Isolation

Every database query is scoped to your workspace. It is architecturally impossible for a query to return data belonging to another workspace or organization.

## Data Security

### Encryption at Rest

All secrets, API keys, and third-party credentials are encrypted before being written to the database using **AES-256-GCM**. The encryption key is derived from a master secret not accessible to application-layer code or OptiDev employees. Decrypted values are never written to logs.

### Encryption in Transit

All traffic is encrypted via **TLS 1.2+** enforced at the Cloudflare edge. Internal service-to-service communication runs over private cluster networking.

### Secret Visibility Tiers

OptiDev gives you fine-grained control over how secrets are handled in the UI:

| Tier | Behavior |
|---|---|
| **Visible** | Always shown in plain text — for non-sensitive config values |
| **Masked** | Hidden by default; user can reveal temporarily with a toggle |
| **Sensitive** | Write-only — once saved, the value can never be retrieved, only rotated |

### No Secrets in Logs

Decrypted secret values are never written to application logs. Logs contain only IDs, key names, and metadata.

### Presigned URLs for Build Artifacts

Build outputs, deployment packages, and code archives are delivered via time-limited presigned URLs. No cloud credentials are ever injected into container environments.

---

## Development Container Security

Each workspace gets a dedicated container running in full isolation:

- Runs in its own Kubernetes namespace — no shared runtime with other workspaces
- Network policies deny all ingress between containers
- Resource quotas are enforced per container
- Containers run as non-root users

Access to your container is brokered exclusively through the OptiDev API after authentication. There is no path for one user to access another user's container.

---

## AI Security

OptiDev's AI assistant is powered by Anthropic's Claude API.

### What the AI can access

- Files in your current project
- Project metadata (name, framework type)
- Your conversation history within the active session

### What the AI cannot access

- Files or data from other workspaces
- Your secrets or API keys — decrypted values are never passed to the AI
- Data from other users or tenants

### AI data handling

<Note>
Per Anthropic's API data usage policy, customer code and conversations submitted via the API are not used to train AI models.
</Note>

- Claude sessions are scoped to a single workspace — no cross-workspace context leakage
- API keys for AI calls are injected at runtime — no credentials are embedded in container images

## Third-Party Subprocessors

| Subprocessor | Role | Region |
|---|---|---|
| Oracle Cloud Infrastructure | Compute, Kubernetes, object storage, PostgreSQL, Redis | US |
| Cloudflare | CDN, DDoS protection, TLS, R2 storage | US |
| Google Firebase | User authentication, MFA, SAML federation | US |
| Anthropic | AI coding assistant (Claude API) | US |
| Google Gemini | Image generation | US |
| Stripe | Payment processing, usage-based billing | US |
| Supabase | Backend-as-a-service provisioning for user projects | US |
