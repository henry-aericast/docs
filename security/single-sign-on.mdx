## What is SSO?

Single Sign-On lets your team access OptiDev using their existing company login — the same one they use for email, Slack, or other work apps.

**Benefits:**
- **One password** — no separate OptiDev account to remember
- **IT control** — manage access through your identity provider
- **Instant offboarding** — when someone leaves, access is revoked automatically

---

## How It Works

```
┌──────────────┐      ┌──────────────┐      ┌──────────────┐
│    User      │ ───► │  Your IdP    │ ───► │   OptiDev    │
│  clicks      │      │ (Okta/Azure) │      │   account    │
│  "Sign In"   │      │  verifies    │      │   created    │
└──────────────┘      └──────────────┘      └──────────────┘
```

1. User visits OptiDev and clicks **Sign in with SSO**
2. They're redirected to your company's login page (Okta, Azure AD, etc.)
3. After entering their company credentials, they're sent back to OptiDev
4. OptiDev creates their account automatically on first login

## Before You Start

You'll need:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Admin access to your IdP" icon="user-shield">
    You need to create a new SAML application in Okta, Azure AD, or your identity provider.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Your company email domain" icon="at">
    The domain you want to enable SSO for (e.g., `yourcompany.com`).
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## What Happens After Setup

### For Your Team
- Employees visit OptiDev and click **Sign in with SSO**
- They enter their company email and are redirected to your IdP
- After authentication, they land in OptiDev — account created automatically

### For IT Admins
- New employees get OptiDev access through your IdP (no manual invites)
- Terminated employees lose access immediately when disabled in your IdP
- You control which groups/teams can access OptiDev

---

## Managing Users

Once SSO is enabled, user management happens in your identity provider:

| Task | Where to Do It |
|------|----------------|
| Add a new user | Your IdP (Okta/Azure AD) |
| Remove a user | Your IdP — disable or remove from the app |
| Reset password | Your IdP — OptiDev doesn't store passwords |
| Change user's role | OptiDev workspace settings (after they've logged in) |

<Tip>
  Users must log in at least once before you can assign them to workspaces or change their role in OptiDev.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="User can't log in with SSO">
    - Verify the user is assigned to the OptiDev app in your IdP
    - Check their email domain matches your SSO-enabled domain
    - Confirm SSO is fully configured and tested
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="User sees 'SSO not configured' error">
    - The email domain may not be linked to your SSO setup
    - Contact your IT admin to verify domain configuration
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="User is logged in but can't access workspaces">
    - New SSO users need to be added to a workspace after first login
    - Ask your workspace admin to invite them
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
