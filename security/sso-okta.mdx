## Step 1: Get Your OptiDev SSO Settings

    | **SP Entity ID** | `https://auth.optiprime.com/saml/abc123` |
    | **ACS URL** | `https://auth.optiprime.com/saml/abc123/acs` |
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Create a SAML App in Okta

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Okta Admin Console">
    Log in to your Okta admin console at `https://your-domain-admin.okta.com`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to Applications">
    In the sidebar, click **Applications → Applications**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create New App">
    Click **Create App Integration**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select SAML 2.0">

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Configure SAML Settings

On the "Configure SAML" screen, enter these values:

### General Settings

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Single sign-on URL** | Paste your **ACS URL** from Step 1 |

## Step 4: Complete App Setup

On the feedback screen:

1. Select **I'm an Okta customer adding an internal app**
2. Click **Finish**

## Step 5: Get Okta Details for OptiDev

Now you need to copy values from Okta back to OptiDev.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open SAML Setup Instructions">
    On your new app's page, click the **Sign On** tab, then click **View SAML setup instructions**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy These Values">
    You'll need three pieces of information:

    | From Okta | What It's Called |
    |-----------|------------------|
    | Identity Provider Single Sign-On URL | **SSO URL** |
    | Identity Provider Issuer | **Entity ID** |
    | X.509 Certificate | **Certificate** |
  </Step>
  <Step title="Download the Certificate">
    Click to download the certificate. Open it in a text editor — you'll paste the contents into OptiDev.
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Step 6: Enter Okta Details in OptiDev

<Steps>
  <Step title="Return to OptiDev SSO Settings">
    Go back to **Workspace Settings → Security → Single Sign-On**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter IdP Configuration">
    Fill in the fields:

    | Field | Value |
    |-------|-------|
    | **Display Name** | `Okta` (or your company name) |
    | **Entity ID** | Paste the Identity Provider Issuer from Okta |
    | **SSO URL** | Paste the Single Sign-On URL from Okta |
    | **Certificate** | Paste the entire certificate content (including `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----`) |
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Your Email Domain">
    Enter your company's email domain (e.g., `yourcompany.com`).

    All users with this email domain will be directed to Okta for login.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Configuration">
    Click **Save** to enable SSO.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 7: Assign Users in Okta

Before users can log in, you need to give them access to the app in Okta.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Assignments">
    In Okta, open your OptiDev app and click the **Assignments** tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign Users or Groups">
    Click **Assign** and choose:
    - **Assign to People** — for individual users
    - **Assign to Groups** — for entire teams or departments
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Assigning a group is easier to manage. Create an "OptiDev Users" group and add employees who need access.
</Tip>

---

## Step 8: Test Your Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open an Incognito Window">
    Use a private/incognito browser window to avoid cached sessions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to OptiDev">
    Visit `https://app.optidev.ai` and click **Sign in with SSO**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Your Email">
    Enter your company email address. You should be redirected to Okta.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Log In">
    Sign in with your Okta credentials. You should land in OptiDev.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
  If you see your OptiDev dashboard, SSO is working. Your team can now log in with their Okta credentials.
</Check>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Error: 'SAML assertion invalid'">
    - Double-check the **ACS URL** in Okta matches exactly what OptiDev shows
    - Verify the certificate was copied completely (including BEGIN/END lines)
    - Check that attribute names are lowercase (`email`, not `Email`)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Error: 'User not assigned'">
    - Go to your Okta app's **Assignments** tab
    - Make sure the user (or their group) is assigned to the OptiDev app
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="User redirected to wrong IdP">
    - Verify the email domain is correctly configured in OptiDev
    - Check that only one SSO configuration exists for this domain
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Login works but user has no access">
    - The user account was created, but they need to be added to a workspace
    - Go to **Workspace Settings → Members** and invite them
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
