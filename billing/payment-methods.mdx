## Secure Payments with Stripe

OptiDev uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com) to process all payments. Your payment information is handled securely by Stripe — we never store your card details on our servers.

## Accepted Payment Methods

When you subscribe or purchase credits, Stripe Checkout accepts:

- **Credit cards** — Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover
- **Debit cards** — Most major debit cards

<Info>
Available payment methods may vary by region. Stripe automatically shows the options available in your location.
