## What Are Credits?

Credits are how OptiDev measures AI usage. Every time the agent builds, edits, or generates something for you, it uses credits based on the complexity of the task.

**Simple tasks** (small edits, quick fixes) use fewer credits.
**Complex tasks** (building new features, large changes) use more credits.

### Credit Allocation

| Plan | Monthly Billing | Yearly Billing |
|------|-----------------|----------------|
| Free | 100 credits (one-time) | — |
| Standard | 100 credits/month | 1,200 credits upfront |
| Pro | 200 credits/month | 2,400 credits upfront |

### Credit Reset

- **Monthly plans**: Credits reset at the start of each billing cycle
- **Yearly plans**: You get all credits upfront when you subscribe
- **No rollover**: Unused credits don't carry over to the next cycle
