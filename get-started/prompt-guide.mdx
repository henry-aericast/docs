## Make a Plan

5-10 minutes of planning saves hours of work and produces better results.

### Give Context About Yourself

Include who you are, your organization, and your end goal:

> *"I'm a Growth Analyst for a SaaS company. I need to build a Stripe Dashboard showing recent subscriptions and new trial signups."*

This helps the agent understand your perspective and make better decisions.

### Use Modifiers to Shape Output

Instead of basic instructions, add modifiers that encourage quality:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Basic">
    > *"Create an analytics dashboard"*
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Better">
    > *"Create an analytics dashboard. Include as many relevant features and interactions as possible. Go beyond the basics to create a fully-featured implementation."*
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Describe Business Outcomes

Focus on what you want to achieve, not technical details:

> *"For the kiosk app:*
> - *If idle for 60 seconds, return to the attract screen*
> - *Users can swipe left/right to view different slides*
> - *Tap anywhere to go to product details"*

### Review the Plan

The agent creates a plan before building. Take time to review it and request changes before approving.

## Building Frontend

### A Picture is Worth a Thousand Words

Attach visual references to help the agent understand what you want:

- **Screenshots** of websites or apps you like
- **Figma designs** copied as images
- **URLs** to reference sites

> *"Scan this website and document the brand guidelines - colors, fonts, spacing. Use these throughout the app."*

### Use the Visual Editor

For quick design tweaks, the Visual Editor is often faster than prompting:

- Click elements to edit text directly
- Change colors and fonts without code
- Adjust spacing and layout visually

<Tip>
Use the Visual Editor for small changes. For bigger features, describe them to the Agent.
</Tip>

### Request Features Explicitly

Animations and interactive elements won't appear unless you ask:

> *"Add a smooth fade-in animation when the page loads. Make the buttons scale up slightly on hover."*

### Reference Component Libraries

Your project includes [shadcn/ui components](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components). Reference them by name:

> *"Use the Card component to display product info with image, title, and price."*

> *"Add a Dialog for the confirmation popup."*

---

## Working with Files

### Attach Reference Files

Upload PDFs, images, or documents for the agent to read and understand:

> *"Read the attached brand guidelines PDF and follow these standards."*

### Use Images in Your App

Attach images and tell the agent where to use them:

> *"Use this image as the hero background on the homepage."*

### Add Downloadable Files

For files users can download:

1. Activate **OptiDev Cloud**
2. Go to **Storage** and upload your files
3. Tell the agent:

> *"Add a Download section. When users click the button, download `my_document.pdf` from OptiDev Cloud Storage."*

---

## OptiDev Cloud & Backend

If you need database access, API integrations, or user authentication:

1. **Activate OptiDev Cloud first** before asking the agent to build backend features
2. **Add API keys to Secrets** in your project's OptiDev Cloud settings
3. **Tell the agent** which secrets are available

> *"My Stripe API key is stored in OptiDev Cloud Secrets as `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`. Use it to fetch subscription data."*

---

## Working with API Keys

### Be Explicit About Available Keys

AI agents are cautious around credentials by design. Always tell the agent explicitly:

> *"The Stripe API key is available in OptiDev Cloud Secrets. You can use it safely."*

### Start with Least Privilege

Always use the most restricted keys possible:

- Read-only keys for dashboards and data displays
- Limited-scope keys for specific operations
- Never use admin or full-access keys unless absolutely necessary

### Provide Documentation

Help the agent find the right API patterns:

> *"Search for the latest Stripe API documentation for listing subscriptions."*

Or paste direct links:

> *"Use this API reference: https://stripe.com/docs/api/subscriptions/list"*

<Note>
Many APIs like Stripe and Shopify offer "Copy as Markdown" or `llms.txt` files. These are excellent for giving the agent accurate context.
</Note>

### Give Example Data

You know your business better than the agent. Provide examples:

> *"Here's a sample API response from our system. Notice we only want to display subscriptions where `status` is 'active' and `product_id` starts with 'prod_premium'."*

You can even attach CSV or JSON files with sample data for analysis.

---

## Session Management

### Starting New Sessions

As your project grows, starting fresh sessions can help:

> *"Read through the project to understand the current state. I want to add a new feature for user notifications."*

This gives the agent context without carrying over confusion from previous work.

### Context Windows

Long sessions can lose focus. If the agent seems confused or repetitive, start a new session with clear instructions about where you left off.

---

## Self Documentation

Good documentation becomes more valuable than the code over time.

### Keep a Changelog

After significant changes:

> *"Update CHANGELOG.md with the features we just added."*

### Maintain Project Notes

Ask the agent to document architecture decisions:

> *"Update CLAUDE.md with notes about the authentication flow we implemented."*

**Guidelines for CLAUDE.md:**
- Keep under 250 lines (ideally 150 or less)
- 2-3 sentence high-level intro focused on business purpose
- ASCII diagrams for critical architecture
- File/folder structure with one-line explanations
- No future plans or philosophy - just current state

---

## Models

Choose the right model for your task:

| Model | Best For | Speed |
|-------|----------|-------|
| **Fast** (Haiku 4.5) | Quick prototypes, simple changes, POCs | Fastest |
| **Quality** (Sonnet 4.5) | Most tasks, recommended default | Balanced |
| **Best** (Opus 4.5) | Complex architecture, difficult problems | Slowest |

<Tip>
A good workflow: Use Quality mode to create a plan, then switch to Fast mode to build it quickly.
</Tip>

---

## Debugging

### Attach Screenshots

When something isn't working, show the agent what you see:

> *"Here's a screenshot of the error. The button click isn't working."*

### Start Simple

For easy issues, just ask the agent to fix it. For complex problems:

> *"Analyze this issue deeper. Look at the related files and come up with a plan to fix it. Don't make changes yet."*

### Verify Before Fixing

If the agent's first attempts don't work:

> *"Before making more changes, confirm this is the real fix and not a workaround. Show me evidence from the code."*

This forces deeper analysis and better solutions.

## Stopping and Starting Over

### Don't Be Afraid to Stop

Click **Stop** anytime - even mid-task - to:

- Give clarification
- Change direction
- Ask questions about what it's doing

### When to Start Fresh

**Build a new app** when:
- You're only a few steps in and things aren't going well
- Your original prompt was unclear
- A few word changes could produce better results

**Start a new session** when:
- The agent isn't making progress on a bug
- Responses seem confused or repetitive
- You want to approach a problem differently

---

## Final Words

Consider this parable:

> A man riding a horse. Someone asks: "Where are you going?"
>
> The man replies: "I don't know, ask the horse."

The agent is the horse. You are the rider. **Stay in control.**

- Review plans before approving
- Stop and redirect when needed
- Provide clear context and goals
- Trust your judgment about your business

The best apps come from clear direction and thoughtful collaboration.
