## Build Your First App

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a New Project">
    From your dashboard, click **Create New App**.

    Tell our AI what you want to create. Be as specific as you like:
    - "A dashboard showing Stripe subscriptions and new trial signups"
    - "A kiosk showcasing this week's featured car for my dealership"
    - "An 8-bit arcade game like Galaga"
    - "Redesign my website www.mysite.com to be modern while keeping my brand content"

    Our AI will ask smart follow-up questions to nail down exactly what you need.

  <Step title="Build with the Power Editor">
    Your project opens in the **Power Editor** — and you're in control. Choose how you want to build:

    | Mode | Best For |
    |------|----------|
    | **Agent** | Chat with Claude AI to write code for you |
    | **Visual** | Point-and-click editing for design changes |
    | **Code** | Write React/TypeScript directly |

    See your changes instantly with live preview as you build.
