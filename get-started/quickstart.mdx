## What is OptiDev?

OptiDev is an AI-powered platform that turns your ideas into fully functional web applications. Describe what you want, and watch it come to life.

**No coding experience? No problem.** If you can describe it, you can build it.

---

## Step 1: Start with a Plan

Go to [app.optidev.ai/dashboard](https://app.optidev.ai/dashboard) and click **Create New App**.

Give OptiDev Agent context about who you are and what you're building:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Kiosk Example">
    > *"I'm a Marketing Coordinator for a Harley Davidson dealer in Texas. I need to create a kiosk page for our touchscreen display on the showroom floor. We're highlighting the Pan America 1250 ST model this month."*
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Dashboard Example">
    > *"I'm a Growth Analyst for a SaaS company. I need to build a Stripe Dashboard showing recent subscriptions and new trial signups."*
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The more context you provide, the better your app will be.

---

## Step 2: Attach Context

You can attach files and links to help OptiDev Agent understand exactly what you want:

| Attachment Type | How to Use |
|-----------------|------------|
| **Screenshots** | Paste images of websites, apps, or designs as reference |
| **Documents** | Attach PDFs or docs with product info, brand guidelines, etc. |
| **URLs** | Paste website links and ask the agent to use them as reference |
| **Images** | Attach photos to include in your app, or ask the agent to generate them |

### Example with Attachments

> *"I want the kiosk to have an attract screen that slides through these 3 images. [attach images]*
>
> *Read this URL https://www.harley-davidson.com/us/en/motorcycles/pan-america-1250-st.html for product info and write a short description for each slide.*
>
> *When someone taps the screen, show a page explaining how to order with this month's special discount."*

Describe your app like you're telling a friend to build it for you.

## Step 3: Review and Build

OptiDev Agent creates a plan before building. This saves time by catching issues early.

### Review the Plan

- Read through what the agent proposes to build
- Ask for changes if something isn't right
- Approve when you're happy with the direction

### First Build

Click **Approve** and the agent starts building. First builds typically take **5-15 minutes** depending on complexity.

You'll see live progress as the agent writes code, creates components, and sets up your app.

<Note>
Grab a coffee while your app is being built. The agent will let you know when it's ready for review.
</Note>

---

## Step 4: Refine Your App

Once the first build is complete, refine it until it's exactly what you want.

### Give Feedback

- **Take a screenshot** of what you see and paste it into the chat
- Point out specific things: *"Make the header text larger"* or *"Change the CTA button to red"*
- Reference components by name: *"Update the hero section..."*

### Use the Visual Editor

For quick design tweaks, switch to the **Visual** tab:

- Click any element to select it
- Edit text directly on the page
- Change colors, fonts, and spacing without code

<Tip>
The Visual Editor is perfect for small changes. For bigger features, describe them to the Agent.
</Tip>

## Step 5: Publish and Share

When you're happy with your app, click **Publish** in the top right corner.

Your app builds and deploys in seconds. You'll get a public URL to share immediately.

### Connect Your Own Domain

Want to use your own domain like `app.yourcompany.com`?

See [Custom Domain](/features/custom-domain) for setup instructions.
