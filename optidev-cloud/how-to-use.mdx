## What is OptiDev Cloud

OptiDev Cloud is a ready-to-use backend for your app. It gives you everything you need to build real applications:

- **Database** - Store and organize your app's data (user profiles, orders, messages, etc.)
- **Authentication** - Let users create accounts and log in securely
- **Edge Functions** - Run server-side code for things like payment processing or sending emails
- **Storage** - Store files like images, documents, and videos

The best part? You don't need to set up servers or manage infrastructure. Just activate OptiDev Cloud and start building.

### Works with OptiDev Agent

OptiDev Agent understands OptiDev Cloud automatically. You can simply describe what you need:

- *"Create a table to store customer orders with name, email, and order total"*
- *"Add user login to my app"*
- *"Create an API endpoint that connects to Stripe for payments"*

OptiDev Agent will create the tables, set up authentication, write the functions, and deploy everything for you.

## Activating OptiDev Cloud

### Step 1: Open OptiDev Cloud

In your project, click the **OptiDev Cloud** tab in the left sidebar (cloud icon).

### Step 2: Choose a Region

Select a region closest to where your users are located:

| Region | Best for |
|--------|----------|
| US East (Ohio) | North America |
| EU Central (Frankfurt) | Europe |
| AP Southeast (Singapore) | Asia |
| AP Southeast (Sydney) | Australia/Oceania |

Choosing a closer region means faster response times for your users.

### Step 3: Activate

Click the **Activate OptiDev Cloud** button. You'll see a progress bar while your backend is being set up.

This usually takes 1-2 minutes. When complete, you'll see a green **Active** badge and the dashboard will load.

<Note>
Once activated, OptiDev Cloud is ready to use immediately. OptiDev Agent can start creating tables and functions right away.

## Using OptiDev Agent with OptiDev Cloud

The easiest way to work with OptiDev Cloud is through OptiDev Agent. Just describe what you need in plain language.

### Creating Tables

Tell OptiDev Agent what data you want to store:

> *"Create a products table with name, description, price, and image URL"*

2. Add sign-in forms to your app
3. Connect everything together

### Creating API Endpoints

Describe the functionality you need:

> *"Create an API endpoint that accepts payment with Stripe and saves the order to the database"*

OptiDev Agent will:
1. Create an Edge Function with the Stripe integration
2. Deploy it to OptiDev Cloud
3. Connect it to your frontend

2. **Deployed Functions** shows all functions running on OptiDev Cloud
3. Each function shows its name, version, and last update time

### Function Details

Click **View Details** on any function to see:

- Function URL (for calling from your app)
- Execution history
- Recent invocations

### Testing Functions

1. Click **Test** next to any deployed function

## For Developers

<Accordion title="Technical Reference">

### Environment Variables

When you activate OptiDev Cloud, these environment variables are automatically added to your project's `.env.local`:

- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` - Your API endpoint
- `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Your public API key

### Supabase Client

OptiDev Cloud is built on Supabase. You can use the Supabase JavaScript client directly:

```bash
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
```

A pre-configured client is created at `src/lib/supabaseClient.ts` when you activate OptiDev Cloud.

### Database Connection

The connection string uses session pooler (port 5432) for full PostgreSQL compatibility. Use it with any PostgreSQL client or ORM.

### Edge Functions Runtime

Functions run on Deno with TypeScript support. Access secrets via `Deno.env.get('SECRET_NAME')`.
