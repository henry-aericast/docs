## What is OptiDev Cloud

OptiDev Cloud is a ready-to-use backend for your app. It gives you everything you need to build real applications:

- **Database** - Store and organize your app's data (user profiles, orders, messages, etc.)
- **Authentication** - Let users create accounts and log in securely
- **Edge Functions** - Run server-side code for things like payment processing or sending emails
- **Secrets** - Securely manage environment variables and API keys
- **Storage** - Store files like images, documents, and videos
- **Advisors** - Get security and performance recommendations

The best part? You don't need to set up servers or manage infrastructure. OptiDev Cloud is powered by Supabase, giving you production-grade PostgreSQL and infrastructure without any setup. Just activate OptiDev Cloud and start building.

### Works with OptiDev Agent

OptiDev Agent understands OptiDev Cloud automatically. You can simply describe what you need:

- *"Create a table to store customer orders with name, email, and order total"*
- *"Add user login to my app"*
- *"Create an API endpoint that connects to Stripe for payments"*
- *"Set up file upload for profile pictures"*

OptiDev Agent will create the tables, set up authentication, write the functions, and deploy everything for you.

## Activating OptiDev Cloud

### Step 1: Open OptiDev Cloud

In your project, click the **OptiDev Cloud** tab in the left sidebar (cloud icon).

<img
  src="/images/optidev-cloud/how-to-use/cloud_activation.png"
  alt="OptiDev Cloud tab in sidebar"
  style={{maxWidth: "600px"}}
/>

### Step 2: Choose a Region

Select a region closest to where your users are located:

| Region | Best for |
|--------|----------|
| US East (Ohio) | North America |
| EU Central (Frankfurt) | Europe |
| AP Southeast (Singapore) | Asia |
| AP Southeast (Sydney) | Australia/Oceania |

Choosing a closer region means faster response times for your users.

### Step 3: Activate

Click the **Activate OptiDev Cloud** button. You'll see a progress bar while your backend is being set up.

**Instant Activation:** OptiDev Cloud uses a warm pool system that pre-provisions resources, so activation typically completes in under a second (compared to 2-3 minutes for traditional backends). The progress bar shows elapsed time and updates every few seconds.

When complete, you'll see a green **Active** badge and the dashboard will load with all tabs ready to use.

<Note>
Once activated, OptiDev Cloud is ready to use immediately. OptiDev Agent can start creating tables, functions, and storage buckets right away.

## Using OptiDev Agent with OptiDev Cloud

The easiest way to work with OptiDev Cloud is through OptiDev Agent. Just describe what you need in plain language.

### Creating Tables

Tell OptiDev Agent what data you want to store:

> *"Create a products table with name, description, price, and image URL"*

OptiDev Agent will:
1. Create the table with the right column types
2. Set up the database schema
3. Show you the table in your dashboard

### Adding Authentication

Ask OptiDev Agent to add login:

> *"Add user authentication to my app with email and Google sign-in"*

OptiDev Agent will:

[Learn more about Storage →](/optidev-cloud/storage)

### Managing Secrets

Request secure environment variable storage:

> *"Store my Stripe API key securely so I can use it in Edge Functions"*

OptiDev Agent will:
1. Create a secret with your API key
2. Update your Edge Function code to use `Deno.env.get('STRIPE_API_KEY')`

3. Browse rows using the pagination controls at the bottom

### Editing Data

- **Double-click** any cell to edit it
- Press **Enter** to save or **Escape** to cancel
- Click **Add Row** to create a new entry

### Running Queries

Type SQL in the editor to search or analyze your data:

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE total > 100
```

Click **Execute Query** to see results. The result table shows the row count and handles null values, objects, and strings with proper formatting.

---

## Viewing Users

1. Go to the **Users** tab
2. You'll see a paginated list of all registered users
3. Each user shows:
   - Email address
   - When they signed up
   - Last sign-in time
   - Auth provider used (email, phone, or Google)

Use the pagination controls at the bottom to navigate through large user lists.

---

## Monitoring Edge Functions

### Viewing Deployed Functions

1. Go to the **Edge Functions** tab
2. **Deployed Functions** shows all functions running on OptiDev Cloud
3. Each function shows its name, version, and last update time

If you see a **"Needs Sync"** badge, it means the workspace version is different from the deployed version.

### Function Details

Click **View Details** on any function to see:

- Function URL (for calling from your app)
- Execution history
- Recent invocations
- Version number

### Testing Functions

1. Click **Test** next to any deployed function
2. Choose the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
3. Add headers, query parameters, or request body data
4. Click **Send Request** to see the response

The response shows:
- Status code with color-coded badge
- Response body (formatted JSON)

This is useful for debugging before connecting to your app.

## For Developers

<Accordion title="Technical Reference">

### Environment Variables

When you activate OptiDev Cloud, these environment variables are automatically added to your project's `.env.local`:

- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` - Your API endpoint
- `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Your public API key

### Supabase Client

OptiDev Cloud is built on Supabase. You can use the Supabase JavaScript client directly:

```bash
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
```

A pre-configured client is created at `src/lib/supabaseClient.ts` when you activate OptiDev Cloud.

### Database Connection

The connection string uses session pooler (port 5432) for full PostgreSQL compatibility. Use it with any PostgreSQL client or ORM.

The pooler provides dynamic host resolution via Supabase's pooler config API for optimal connection management.

### Edge Functions Runtime

Functions run on Deno with TypeScript support. Access secrets via `Deno.env.get('SECRET_NAME')`.

**Auto-injected environment variables:**
- `SUPABASE_URL` - Your project URL
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Public (publishable) key
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Admin key with full access
- `SUPABASE_DB_URL` - Direct database connection string

### Storage Integration

Upload files using presigned URLs for efficient binary transfer (33% more efficient than base64):

```typescript
// OptiDev Agent handles this automatically
const { data, error } = await supabase.storage
  .from('avatars')
  .upload('user-123.jpg', file)
```

### Encryption and Security

All OptiDev Cloud configurations (API keys, connection strings, secrets) are encrypted using AES-256-GCM with your workspace encryption key. Data is automatically encrypted before storage and decrypted on retrieval.

### Multi-Tenant Isolation

All queries are automatically scoped to your workspace ID, ensuring complete isolation between different projects and users.

### Warm Pool System

OptiDev Cloud uses a warm pool of pre-provisioned Supabase projects for instant activation (under 100ms vs 2-3 minutes). The system automatically replenishes the pool in the background and falls back to direct provisioning if the pool is empty.
