## What is the Database

The database is where your app stores all its information - user profiles, products, orders, messages, settings, and more. Think of it like a collection of spreadsheets, where each "table" holds a specific type of data.

OptiDev Cloud gives you a fully managed PostgreSQL database. This means:

- **No setup required** - Your database is ready as soon as you activate OptiDev Cloud
- **Automatic backups** - Your data is safely backed up
- **Fast and reliable** - Hosted on global infrastructure with high availability

## Creating Tables with OptiDev Agent

The easiest way to create tables is to describe what you need to OptiDev Agent.

### Example: Product Catalog

> *"Create a products table with name, description, price, category, and whether it's in stock"*

OptiDev Agent will create a table with the right columns and data types automatically.

### Example: Customer Orders

> *"I need to track orders. Each order has a customer email, list of items, total amount, shipping address, and order status"*

OptiDev Agent will:
1. Create the orders table
2. Set up appropriate column types (text for email, number for total, etc.)
3. Add a timestamp for when orders are created

### Example: Blog Posts

> *"Create tables for a blog with posts and comments. Posts have a title, content, author, and publish date. Comments belong to a post and have the commenter name and message"*

OptiDev Agent understands relationships between tables and will set them up correctly.

## Browsing Tables in the Dashboard

### Viewing Your Tables

1. Go to the **Database** tab in OptiDev Cloud
2. The left sidebar shows all your tables
3. Click any table name to see its data

### Understanding the Table View

When you click a table, you'll see:

- **Columns** - The header row shows all fields in your table
- **Rows** - Each row is one record (one product, one order, one user, etc.)
- **Row count** - Shows how many total records exist

### Navigating Large Tables

Use the pagination controls at the bottom:

- **Rows per page** - Choose to show 10, 25, 50, or 100 rows at a time
- **Page navigation** - Click arrows or page numbers to browse through data
- **Row counter** - Shows which rows you're viewing (e.g., "Showing 1-50 of 1,234")

## Editing Data

### Editing a Single Cell

1. **Double-click** any cell you want to edit
2. Type the new value
3. Press **Enter** to save, or **Escape** to cancel

The change is saved immediately to your database.

### Adding a New Row

1. Click the **Add Row** button above the results
2. Fill in the values for each column
3. Click **Add Row** to save

### Selecting Multiple Rows

- Click the checkbox next to any row to select it
- Use the checkbox in the header to select all visible rows
- Selected rows can be exported or copied together

## Running SQL Queries

For more advanced data access, you can write SQL queries directly.

### The SQL Editor

Above the results table, you'll see a code editor. This is where you write SQL queries.

### Basic Queries

**View all data from a table:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM products
```

**Find specific records:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE status = 'pending'
```

**Search by date:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE created_at > '2024-01-01'
```

**Count records:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE total > 100
```

### Running a Query

1. Type your SQL in the editor
2. Click **Execute Query** (or the play button)
3. Results appear in the table below

### Quick Table Selection

Click any table name in the sidebar, and the editor automatically fills in:
```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name LIMIT 10;
```

This is a quick way to preview any table's data.

---

## Exporting Data

### Export Options

Click the **menu icon** (three dots) above the results to see export options:

- **Export to JSON** - For use in other applications or backups
- **Export to CSV** - Opens in Excel, Google Sheets, or any spreadsheet app
- **Export to Excel** - Direct Excel-compatible format
- **Copy as SQL** - Get INSERT statements to recreate the data elsewhere

### Exporting Selected Rows

1. Select rows using the checkboxes
2. Click the menu icon
3. Choose "Export selected to..." for your preferred format

This is useful when you only need a subset of your data.

## Managing Tables with OptiDev Agent

### Adding Columns

> *"Add a 'discount_percent' column to the products table"*

### Modifying Data

> *"Update all orders from last month to have status 'archived'"*

### Creating Sample Data

> *"Add 10 sample products to the products table with realistic names and prices"*

### Analyzing Data

> *"Show me the top 10 customers by total order value"*

OptiDev Agent can write and run complex queries for you, then explain the results.

---

## Common Tasks

### Finding Records

**By exact match:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'john@example.com'
```

**By partial match:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE '%shirt%'
```

**By multiple conditions:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE status = 'shipped' AND total > 50
```

### Sorting Results

**Newest first:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM orders ORDER BY created_at DESC
```

**Alphabetically:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY name ASC
```

### Limiting Results

**First 10 records:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM products LIMIT 10
```

**Skip and limit (for pagination):**
```sql
SELECT * FROM products LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20
```

## Tips and Best Practices

### Let OptiDev Agent Help

If you're not sure how to write a query, just ask:

> *"Show me all orders from the last 7 days sorted by total amount"*

OptiDev Agent will write the SQL and run it for you.

### Use the Table Browser

For quick data checks, just click table names in the sidebar. You don't need to write SQL for basic browsing.

### Export Before Major Changes

Before making big changes to your data, export a backup:

1. Run `SELECT * FROM table_name`
2. Export to JSON or CSV
3. Keep the file as a backup

## For Developers

<Accordion title="Technical Reference">

### PostgreSQL Compatibility

OptiDev Cloud runs PostgreSQL, giving you access to:

- All standard SQL features
- JSON/JSONB columns for flexible data
- Full-text search
- Indexes for performance

### Connection String

Click **Connect** in the Connection Info tab to get your database connection string. Use it with:

- Database clients (TablePlus, DBeaver, pgAdmin)
- ORMs (Prisma, TypeORM, Drizzle)
- Direct PostgreSQL connections

The connection uses session pooler (port 5432) for full compatibility.

### Schema

Tables are created in the `public` schema by default. Use `information_schema` queries for metadata about your tables.

### Row Level Security

OptiDev Cloud supports Row Level Security (RLS) policies. Ask OptiDev Agent to set up policies like:

> *"Only let users see their own orders"*
