## Creating a New User

To manually create a user account:

### Step 1: Open Create User Dialog

Click the **Create User** button at the top of the Users tab.

### Step 2: Fill in User Details

**Required Fields:**
- **Email** - User's email address
- **Password** - Minimum 6 characters

**Optional Fields:**
- **Phone** - Phone number (format: +1234567890)
- **Auto-confirm email** - Check to skip email verification (checked by default)

### Step 3: Create the User

Click **Create User** to add the account.

The new user will appear in your user list immediately. If "Auto-confirm email" was checked, the user can sign in right away without verifying their email.

<Note>
Created users receive the password you set. Make sure to communicate it securely to the user, or send them an invitation instead (see below).
</Note>

---

## Inviting Users

Instead of creating users manually, you can send email invitations that let users set their own password.

### Step 1: Open Invite User Dialog

Click the **Invite User** button at the top of the Users tab.

### Step 2: Enter Invitation Details

**Required Field:**
- **Email** - Email address to send the invitation to

### Step 3: Send the Invitation

Click **Send Invitation**.

The user receives an email with a signup link. When they click it, they can:
1. Set their own password
2. Be redirected to your specified URL

---

## Deleting Users

To permanently remove a user account:

### Step 1: Click Delete Icon

In the Actions column of the user table, click the trash icon for the user you want to delete.

### Step 2: Confirm Deletion

A confirmation dialog appears showing:
- User's email, phone, or "Anonymous User"
- Full user ID
- Warning: "This action cannot be undone"

### Step 3: Delete the User

Click the red **Delete User** button to permanently remove the account.

<Warning>
Deleting a user removes their authentication account but does NOT automatically delete their data from your database tables. If you need to remove user data, you must do that separately via the Database tab or your application code.
</Warning>

## Common Use Cases

### Manually Creating Test Users

For development and testing:

1. Click **Create User**
2. Use test email (e.g., `test@example.com`)
3. Set simple password (e.g., `test123`)
4. Check **Auto-confirm email**
5. Click **Create User**

The test user is immediately available for login testing.

### Inviting Team Members

For production applications:

1. Click **Invite User**
2. Enter team member's email
3. Click **Send Invitation**

They receive a professional onboarding email and set their own secure password.

## User Authentication Flow

Understanding how users appear in this tab:

### Email/Password Signup
1. User registers via your app's signup form
2. User appears in Users tab as "Unverified"
3. User receives confirmation email
4. User clicks link to verify
5. Status changes to "Verified"

### OAuth Signup (Google, GitHub, etc.)
1. User clicks "Sign in with Google" in your app
2. User authenticates with Google
3. User appears in Users tab immediately as "Verified"
4. Provider shows as "Google" (or other OAuth provider)

### Invitation Flow
1. Admin sends invitation via Users tab
2. User receives email with signup link
3. User clicks link and sets password
4. User appears in Users tab as "Verified"

## Integration with Auth Settings

The Users tab works together with the Auth tab settings:

**When you enable Email provider:**
- New users can sign up with email/password
- They appear in Users tab with provider "Email"

**When you enable Google provider:**
- New users can sign up with Google
- They appear in Users tab with provider "Google"

**When you disable signup:**
- Existing users remain in the Users tab
- No new users can register
- You can still manually create users or send invitations

### API Endpoints

**List Users**
```http
GET /api/supabase/projects/:projectId/auth/users?page=1&perPage=50
Authorization: Bearer <firebase-token>
```

**Create User**
```http
POST /api/supabase/projects/:projectId/auth/users
Authorization: Bearer <firebase-token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "password123",
  "phone": "+1234567890",
  "email_confirm": true,
  "user_metadata": {},
  "app_metadata": {}
}
```

POST /api/supabase/projects/:projectId/auth/users/invite
Authorization: Bearer <firebase-token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "newuser@example.com",
  "redirect_to": "https://myapp.com/welcome"
}
```

**Delete User**
```http
DELETE /api/supabase/projects/:projectId/auth/users/:userId
Authorization: Bearer <firebase-token>
```

### User Object Structure

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;                    // UUID
  email?: string;                // Email address
  phone?: string;                // Phone number
  created_at: string;            // ISO 8601 timestamp
  updated_at: string;            // ISO 8601 timestamp
  last_sign_in_at?: string;      // ISO 8601 timestamp
  email_confirmed_at?: string;   // ISO 8601 timestamp
  phone_confirmed_at?: string;   // ISO 8601 timestamp
  invited_at?: string;           // ISO 8601 timestamp
  confirmation_sent_at?: string; // ISO 8601 timestamp
  app_metadata: {
    provider: string;            // "email" | "google" | "github" etc.
  };
  user_metadata: Record<string, any>; // Custom user data
}
```

### User Metadata

**app_metadata**
- System-level metadata
- Contains provider information
- Set automatically by OptiDev Cloud
- Read-only in most cases

**user_metadata**
- Custom user data for your application
- Can be set during user creation
- Editable via API
- Examples: profile picture URL, preferences, onboarding status

### Supabase SDK Usage

OptiDev Cloud uses the official Supabase JavaScript SDK for user management:

```typescript
// List users
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.admin.listUsers({
  page: 1,
  perPage: 50
})

// Create user
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.admin.createUser({
  email: 'user@example.com',
  password: 'password123',
  email_confirm: true
})

// Delete user
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.admin.deleteUser(userId)

// Invite user
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.admin.inviteUserByEmail(
  'user@example.com',
  { redirectTo: 'https://myapp.com/welcome' }
)
```

### Security Considerations

**Authentication**
- All API calls require valid Firebase authentication token
- User management requires admin privileges

**Password Requirements**
- Minimum 6 characters
- Should enforce stronger requirements in production
- Consider using password strength validation in your app

**Data Privacy**
- User passwords are never returned by the API
- Sensitive data should be stored encrypted in user_metadata
- Follow GDPR/privacy regulations for user data

### Rate Limits

Be aware of potential rate limits:
- User creation: ~60 requests per minute
- User listing: ~100 requests per minute
- User deletion: ~60 requests per minute

For bulk operations, consider batching and adding delays between requests.
